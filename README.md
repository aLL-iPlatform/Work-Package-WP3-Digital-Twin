# Work-Package-WP3-Digital-Twin
The digital twinning is scheduled to be demonstrated on the design model developed on the ANN/CNN at the cloud data clusters


Here is a Python program to be enabled on TensorFlow to develop a digital twin to be demonstrated on the design model developed on the ANN/CNN at the cloud data clusters. It is set, designed, developed, trained, and to be updated at Google Cloud using the TensorFlow. The digital twin is replicated against physical surrogates built by physical data and data browsed at the internet using datasets at the Cloud, all through the product life cycle:

# Import the necessary libraries
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Load the datasets from the internet
train_data = np.load('train_data.npy')
test_data = np.load('test_data.npy')

# Create a model using the Sequential API
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(train_data, epochs=10)

# Evaluate the performance of the model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_data)

print('Test accuracy:', test_acc)

# Create the digital twin
digital_twin = model.predict(test_data)

# Save the digital twin
np.save('digital_twin.npy', digital_twin)

print('Digital twin created successfully!')
